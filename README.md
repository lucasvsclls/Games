# My C Games Repository

Welcome to my repository of simple games written in C! This collection includes various games that showcase basic programming concepts and offer a fun way to practice coding in C.

## Requirements

To compile and run these games, you will need:
1. **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** - a C compiler.
2. **Command Prompt** on Windows.

If you don’t already have GCC installed, follow the instructions below to set it up.

### Installing GCC on Windows

1. Download and install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/), which provides GCC for Windows.
2. During installation, make sure to select `gcc` and `g++` for installation in the MinGW Installation Manager.
3. Add the `bin` directory of your MinGW installation (usually `C:\MinGW\bin`) to your system’s PATH environment variable. This allows you to run `gcc` from any directory in the command prompt.

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasvsclls/Games.git
cd your-repository
```

## Compiling and Running a Game

To compile one of the games, navigate to the game’s directory and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc game_name.c -o game_name.exe
```
To Run, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
game_name
```
